            <p>Utthita Trikonasana, or Extended Triangle Pose, is a foundational standing yoga pose. It is often included in yoga sequences as it helps to increase flexibility in the hips, hamstrings, and spine, while also strengthening the legs and core.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <p>
                Trikonasana, also known as Utthita Trikonasana, is an asymmetrical standing pose in yoga. In this pose, both of the practitioner's knees are straight, while their feet are approximately one leg's length apart on the ground, with both feet firmly placed on the floor. When practicing triangle pose, utthita trikonasana, we bend the body sideways, improving overall spine flexibility.

            <p>
                In Sanskrit, Trikonasana means Triangle pose or Three Angle pose. Utthita means extended, so it is also called the Extended Triangle pose.

            <h1>TRIKONASANA STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
            <img src="images/trik2.jpg">
            <p>
                No matter which variation of Trikonasana you are practicing, the basic shape of the pose is reasonably constant. Here are the step-by-step instructions to performing the Triangle pose:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Begin in <i>Tadasana</i>, or Mountain pose, standing straight with the feet hip-width apart and the arms at the sides.</li>
                    <br><li>Step or jump the feet one leg's length apart, turning the right foot out 90 degrees and the left foot slightly inwards.</li>
                    <br><li>Inhale and lift the arms parallel to the floor, keeping them aligned at shoulder height, palms facing down.</li>
                    <br><li>Exhale and extend your torso forward—bending from your hip joint, not the waist—to reach your side body directly over your front leg.</li>
                    <br><li>Place the right hand on the right shin, ankle, or floor outside the right foot. If more flexible, place the hand on a block.</li>
                    <br></r><li>Reach the left arm straight up, keeping the arms aligned with the shoulders.</li>
                    <br><li>Hold the pose for a few breaths, lengthening the spine on inhales and deepening the stretch on exhales.</li>
                    <br><li>To release the pose, inhale and lift the torso back up to a standing position, straighten the right leg, and return to Tadasana.</li>
                    <br><li>Repeat on the other side, turning the left foot 90 degrees and repeating the above steps.</li>
                </ol>
