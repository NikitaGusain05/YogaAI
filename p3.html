            <h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR UTKATASANA</h1>
            <p>
                Utkatasana, also called Awkward Chair Pose, may not be suitable for some individuals and may need to be omitted under certain circumstances. It is not for individuals who have recently experienced injuries to the foot or hip or those with chronic knee pain. This pose in <i>yoga</i> places stress on the lower back, making it inadvisable for individuals with lower back issues. Individuals with shoulder problems should avoid extending their arms overhead while practicing Utkatasana, as the full pose involves reaching the arms overhead.

            <img src="images/utk4.jpg">
            <p>
                To perform the chair pose, follow these step-by-step instructions:
                <ol>
                    <br><li>Begin standing tall with the feet hip-distance apart and parallel to each other.</li>
                    <br><li>Inhale and raise the arms overhead with palms facing each other, or bring the palms together.</li>
                    <br><li>Exhale and bend the knees as if one is sitting down in an imaginary chair. Keep the thighs parallel and the knees pointing in the same direction as the toes. The knees will project out slightly over the feet and the torso will form approximately a right angle over your thighs.</li>
                    <br><li>Keep the chest lifted and the tailbone pointing to the floor to engage the core muscles to protect the lower back.</li>
                    <br><li>Gaze forward or slightly upward while engaging the upper back muscles and hold the pose for several breaths.</li>
                    <br><li>To come out of this pose, straighten the knees with an inhalation, lifting strongly through the arms.</li>
                </ol>
