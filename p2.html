        <div id="d1"><br><br>Vrikshasana, or Tree Pose, is a standing and balancing pose in which the practitioner stands on one leg with the lift foot placed against its inner edge. The knee of the lifted leg should point outwards. Hands can be in a prayer position in front of the chest or extended over the head.</div>

            <h1>THE BENEFITS OF VRIKSHASANA</h1>
            <p>Standing balancing poses like the vrikshasana tree pose has profound benefits for <i>yoga practitioners</i>. Some of these benefits include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Improves balance</b>: By lengthening the spine and balancing on one leg, this yoga pose supports one’s stability and overall poise.</li>
                <br><li><b>Strengthens the lower body</b>: The pose helps strengthen the leg muscles, including the inner thighs, hamstrings, and hips. The posture can also aid in strengthening the knee joint by activating the lifted leg.</li>
                <br><li><b>Increases flexibility</b>: As a hip opener pose, practicing one’s hip opening capacity while engaged helps improve hip joint flexibility.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Vrikshasana helps open the <i>Root Chakra</i> by grounding the foot into the ground, improving the stability and foundation of life. At the same time, it activates the <i>Third Eye Chakra</i> by standing tall and gazing forward, supporting one’s perception and awareness.</p>
            <h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS OF VRIKSHASANA</h1>
            <p>While tree pose has many benefits, it is not for everyone and puts those with injuries in a vulnerable position. Those with knee injuries, back pain, hip injury, or ankle sprains should avoid this pose. People with high blood pressure should practice Vrksana with caution. If the practitioner is pregnant, they should consult a doctor before practicing this <i>yoga pose</i>. People who suffer from vertigo should not attempt to do this pose. Make sure to take your time and have a qualified instructor guide you through the posture.</p>
            <h1>INTRODUCTION TO VRKSASANA: A BEGINNER'S GUIDE</h1>
            <p>Beginner tree pose practitioners can follow these step-by-step instructions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing straight, with the legs together and facing forward. Lengthen the front body by maintaining a strong core and pressing the shoulders down.</li>
                <br><li>Engage the core muscles and shift the entire body weight onto the left foot. Bend and lift the right leg off the ground and hold it lightly against the heart center. Actively press the right hip down, so it is in line with the left hip.</li>
                <br><li>Place the right foot firmly against the left thigh or calf, depending on the practitioner’s flexibility. Ground the left leg by feeling the four corners pressing into the ground and keeping a straight leg.</li>
                <br><li>Join the palms together in front of the chest in Anjali Mudra (prayer position). Simultaneously lift both shoulder blades while drawing them slightly rearward as if trying to tuck them under each armpit.</li>
                <br><li>Directing the gaze to one point for better balance will help posture stability. One may lift their arms overhead while taking the upper arms away from the ears.</li>
                <br><li>Reach tall and stay active, holding this posture for 10 seconds to a minute</li>
                <br><li>Lower the arms, separate the palms and return to the standing pose.</li>
                <br><li>Repeat on the other leg.</li>
            </ol>
