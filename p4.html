        <div id="d1"> Virabhadrasana 2 (Warrior 2 Pose), named after Hindu god who incarnated as a human, enhances the strength and stamina of beginner and advanced yogis alike. In the pose, your front knee bends to create a stretch in your hips, your arms engage and extend straight out from your shoulders, and your gaze, or dristhi, remains calm and steady toward your front hand. It is the second of three poses dedicated to Virabhadra.</div>

            <h1>THE BENEFITS OF VIRABHADRASANA 2</h1>
            <p>The posture strengthens your core, including your abs and back muscles, as well as the hip flexors, gluteal muscles, inner thigh, and ankle of the bent leg. In your back leg, the pose stretches the hip flexors, hamstring, and calf muscles. Warrior II stretches your chest, stretches and strengthens your shoulders, and increases your endurance, one bent knee at a time.</p>
            <h1>How to do VIRABHADRASANA 2 Pose</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Face the long side of your mat with your arms stretched straight out from your shoulders and your feet parallel to each other in a wide stance. You want your ankles approximately beneath your wrists.</li>
                <li>Turn your right foot and knee to face the front of the mat.</li>
                <li>Angle your left toes slightly in toward the upper left corner of the mat.</li>
                <li>Bend your right knee and stack it over your right ankle.</li>
                <li>Distribute your weight evenly between both legs. Press down through the outer edge of your back foot.</li>
                <li>Keep the crown of your head stacked over your pelvis and your shoulders over your hips.</li>
                <li>Reach strongly through both arms toward the front and back of the mat and turn your head to look past your right fingertips.</li>
                <li>Stay here for 5â€“10 breaths.</li>
                <li>To come out of the pose, exhale as you press down through your feet, then inhale and straighten your legs. Return your feet to parallel facing the left long side of the mat.</li>
                <li>Repeat on the other side.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>VIRABHADRASANA 2 against a wall</h2>
            <p>To help maintain your balance in this pose, place a block between your shin and the wall for stability. This also prevents your knee from going in front of your ankle.</p>
